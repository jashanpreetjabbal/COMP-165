                <h1>Hello online visitor,</h1>
                <p> I'm Jashanpreet Singh, a dedicated and passionate student with a keen interest in computing science (my major) currently studying Associate of Science at Capilano University (CapU). I also love to discuss geopolitics during my free time (basically gossip). The phrase "Jack of all trades, master of none" describes me best but not for long as I am quite concentrated on my studies. I am good in Python, C, and C++ and my next goal is to start with DSA in Python from spring '24. I have also started with the MERN stack for my web development journey. My passions and interests include all the athletic things like trekking, but as I have lived most of my life in suburban plains in India, I had to take long rides on my bicycle to get to a lower range of Himalayas (I could go by public transport, but it's not fun!). Some of my achievements are that I am currently serving as Chairperson of the Governance Committee at Capilano Student Union, and in my role, I frequently review the policies and host meetings as a mediator. I'm also one of the founding members and Secretary of Capilano Computing Science Student Society.</p>
